Question 1:-
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. Input: nums = [3,0,1], Output: 2 .



Question 2:-
Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution . Input:nums =[-1,2,1,-4],target = 1 , Output: 2





Question 3:-
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. Input:nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 4 (least time complexity preferred)
